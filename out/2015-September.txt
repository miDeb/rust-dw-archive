Subject: [rust-dev] Rust compilation times with FastISel?
Message-ID: <CAMxMwy+z24+jNUUyop85t5VHKfPbmRmB2LkKN+6UEt9mY5s-9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Has anybody tried using FastISel instead of regular ISel provided by LLVM?

I remember that previously we couldn't use FastISel. Maybe that has changed?

What instructions were we using that requires ISel and not FastISel?

I believe this mailing list has been retired. Instead, I'd recommend asking
this question on https://internals.rust-lang.org.
