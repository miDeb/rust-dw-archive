Subject: [rust-dev] Help for a RUST Release Party in Bangladesh
Message-ID: <CACvu-qJWvvXOEH+vdF+VL8mASz+i1SPVo+TZP_wErCHNDf9p+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I am a Mozillian from Bangladesh and a new contributor of Rust. I am
learning RUST for last 1 week and already I have fallen in love. :)

I want to organize a RUST release party (or something like this) in
Bangladesh. I need a good plan to success this release party. In this
event, We will invite some developers and Mozillians. We will take an intro
session and show some good demos of this language. We can show them the
future of this language and many more.
Besides, I want to find out some awesome developers who will continue,
learn and teach others.

Now my request to all that please help me to make a good plan. I need a
demo plan of this event and the resources which will be used in the event.
If this event will success, I can organize more events for RUST.

Last but not least, I just need your help me to organize this event and I
promise, it will be an awesome and successful event. :)


Best Regards,

Is there a way(i.e. a robot) to mirror the contents in read only mode of
reddit/r/rust to this mailling lists?

Subject: [rust-dev] Bare-metal Rust linking with C static library
Message-ID: <CAGG3uoTYFrO_6Lk4GO_XVp3nN9GpEnSu55ziWL4yCK2pAaib6g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on building out a Rust interface to the nRF51x series parts.  I
have a bare metal system working quite well.  The nRF51x has a bluetooth
stack (called Softdevice).  This stack requires the use of supervisor calls
to request the stack to perform certain functions.  My plan is to write a C
library wrapper around these service calls, compile with arm-none-wabi-gcc
and then link this to my Bare-metal rust system.  A large chunk of the work
I have done thus far is based off of STM32 example work done by Jorge
Aparicio (https://github.com/japaric).

Since I have the basics up and running, I am working on trying to get a C
static library built with arm-none-eabi-gcc and archived with
arm-none-eabi-ar to properly link in with my Rust code.

I have the following (very basic) .c file:
uint32_t sum(uint32_t a, uint32_t b)
{
return a + b;
}

I am compiling and linking with the following commands:

arm-none-eabi-gcc -Wall -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -fPIC --specs=nosys.specs
-shared test.c -o test.o

arm-none-eabi-ar -rs libtest.a test.o


In my rust file:

[link(name="test", kind="static")]

extern {

pub fn sum(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32;

}


I then invoke it as a test:

pub fn main() {

        let test_sum = unsafe { sum(2, 3) };

}


I am using a Makefile to execute the rust compiler for some specific
arguments, such as my specific target:

# rustc target

TARGET = thumbv6m-none-eabi


# toolchain prefix

TRIPLE = arm-none-eabi


APP_DIR = src/app

OUT_DIR = target/$(TARGET)/release


DEPS_DIR = $(OUT_DIR)/deps


BINS = $(OUT_DIR)/%.hex

HEXS = $(OUT_DIR)/%.hex

ELFS = $(OUT_DIR)/%.elf

OBJECTS = $(OUT_DIR)/intermediate/%.o

SOURCES = $(APP_DIR)/%.rs


APPS = $(patsubst $(SOURCES),$(BINS),$(wildcard $(APP_DIR)/*.rs))


RUSTC_FLAGS := -C lto -g $(RUSTC_FLAGS)


# don't delete my elf files!

.SECONDARY:


all: rlibs  $(APPS)


clean:

cargo clean


# TODO $(APPS) should get recompiled when the `rlibs` change


$(OBJECTS): $(SOURCES)

mkdir -p $(dir $@)

rustc \

$(RUSTC_FLAGS) \

--crate-type staticlib \

--emit obj \

--target $(TARGET) \

-L $(DEPS_DIR) \

-L ../sd110_lib \

--verbose \

-o $@ \

-ltest \

$<


$(ELFS): $(OBJECTS)

$(TRIPLE)-ld \

--gc-sections \

-T layout.ld \

-o $@ \

$<

#size $@


$(BINS): $(ELFS)

$(TRIPLE)-objcopy \

-O ihex \

$< \

$@


rlibs:

cargo build --target $(TARGET) --verbose --release


The cargo.toml is as follows:

[package]

name = "bmd200eval"

version = "0.1.0"

authors = ["Eric Stutzenberger <eric.stutzenberger at rigado.com>"]


[dependencies.nrf51822]

path = "../nrf51822.rs"


When I run make, I get the following output:

.

.

.

mkdir -p target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/intermediate/

rustc \

-C lto -g  \

--crate-type staticlib \

--emit obj \

--target thumbv6m-none-eabi \

-L target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/deps \

-L ../sd110_lib \

--verbose \

-o target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/intermediate/blink.o \

-ltest \

src/app/blink.rs

src/app/blink.rs:42:9: 42:17 warning: unused variable: `test_sum`,
#[warn(unused_variables)] on by default

src/app/blink.rs:42     let test_sum = unsafe { sum(2, 3) };

                            ^~~~~~~~

arm-none-eabi-ld \

--gc-sections \

-T layout.ld \

-o target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blink.elf \

target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/intermediate/blink.o

target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/intermediate/blink.o: In function
`blink::main':

git/rust-nrf/bmd200eval.rs/src/app/blink.rs:42: undefined reference to `sum'



I have found numerous different references to linking Rust with C and
calling C from Rust but I haven't found a specific answer as to why this
will not link.  As you can see in the Makefile, I have tried to
force rustc's hand in finding and linking against the library, but this
doesn't seem to make a difference.


Is there an issue with how I am building a library?

Since rustc is generating a staticlib in this case, is there some different
method that needs to be used?


Note that I am avoiding the Clang compiler for the moment due to the
following:

https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/29628/using-clang-and-the-s110-issues-with-supervisor-calls-to-the-softdevice/


Essentially, the gist of the above is that Clang is not quite producing the
correct supervisor assembly code for calling in to the bluetooth stack,
especially when optimizations are enabled.


Cheers,

Eric

Hello Eric,

Please note that the rust-dev list is (for better or worse) abandonned.

You may ask questions on either IRC (
https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust), the users
forum (https://users.rust-lang.org/) or StackOverflow.

You may also ask on Reddit (https://reddit.com/r/rust), however it's more
used for announcements than questions in general.

Note that all the community links I gave are accessible directly from
http://www.rust-lang.org/

Good luck with your project!

Hi

What are the rationale for closing this mailing list?

Old rusty hackers are used to MLs.

Could you please point me to the discussion where this has been decided?

Regards
Flavius Aspra

The mailing list is not closed, which is why you can still use it to ask
this question. It is merely dead, as conversation split into the two
forums, users.rust-lang.org and internal.rust-lang.org.

There are configuration options you can set in Discourse to make it work
more like a mailing list, if you would prefer.
