Subject: [rust-dev] Where to include "access" unix function in Rust API
Message-ID: <CALRMi61VWOmhDZr7bnCWL3LcUzVR-0eOODFnUvnNhpJCCs-Vpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I need a function that check the permissions of the current user
in a file (this is the unix access function). In rust i can use the
unsafe function libc::access, but I think must more sense to have it
on the File Metadata object or MetadataExt.

I'm thinking about make a pull request to rust with this function
(calling libc::access) but I want to know if this approach is correct,
and where to include it.

Regards.

Hey! Not sure how you got here, but this mailing list is shut down in favor
of the rust forum <https://users.rust-lang.org>. Feel free to ask your
questions there!

it looks like you may be looking for
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.Permissions.html though.

Why is the list even accepting new messages anymore?  It should be a
read-only archive, with a bounce similar to your reply, pointing to the
users forum.  Is this possible to configure?

Aha, I did get an auto-response from rust-dev-bounces:

"The rust-dev mailing list is no longer active. Please direct your
queries to http://discuss.rust-lang.org/"

Perhaps that should be updated to reflect the users/internals split.
Then I guess the remainder is just to make the list read-only now, and
stop delivering new messages.
